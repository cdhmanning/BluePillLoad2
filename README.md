# BluePillLoad
A programmable load based around the BluePill.

Still WIP.

This load can be controlled via USB serial (or serial) and also has a
manual control using a rotary encoder for input and a 4x20 LCD for output.

The load can be controlled to operate with either a current or power setpoints
(ie. constant current or constant power). It is easy enough to add other features
such as constant resistance or maybe even clever stuff like step/waveform loads.
